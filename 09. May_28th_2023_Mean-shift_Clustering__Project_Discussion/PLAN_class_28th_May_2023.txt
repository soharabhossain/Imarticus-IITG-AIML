Mean-shift Algorithm
-----------------------
> Given a bunch of data points n-dimensional space
> it defines a neighbourhood/regions (e.g. a circular region in a 2D space)

what is the shape of the neighbourhood 
  - circle (radius - small vs large)
  - rectangle (h, w)

> it computes the mean of the data points falling within that region
> then iteratively shifts the mean in the direction of the maximum density (mode)

Project-1
------------

Face Recognition with PCA

1. Build a matrix by reading all the training images (FaceMatrix). Each image is converted into a 1D vector in this matrix (e.g. if there are N number of sample images and M be the dioemsnion of each image after conversion to 1D), the FaceMatrix will have a dimension of NxM.


2. Apply PCA and take the first K Principal Components as EigenFaces.
Use explained variance > cumulative variance >> plot and visually check what is the right value of K.


3. Generate weights as a KxN matrix where K is the number of eigenfaces and N is the number of samples.

4. Find a match with a query image

 i. Project the query image into K-dimensional space

ii. compute the Euclidean distance of the query image with all the images already registered in the system

iii. Select the minimum distance (index of the min distance) (argmin)
