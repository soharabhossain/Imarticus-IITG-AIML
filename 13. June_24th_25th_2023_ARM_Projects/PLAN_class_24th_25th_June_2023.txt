Supervised Learning:
--------------------
Traning data:
(X2, Y2), (X1, Y1), .......(Xn, Yn), (Xk, Yk)

ML model < (X, Y)

 > Classification problem (IRIS flower classification , target values Y are categorical )

 > Regression problem (House selling price prediction)
                      total sq ft. of the house (x)
                      number of bedrooms
                      proximity to a highway
                      ........
                   (target values, y are numeric and continuous data)


 y_hat = constant + coeff * total sq ft. of the house 

 Loss => MSE

 y = c + mx (equation of a line)


Trained Regression model to predict the price of a house:
How have we  tarined this model?

 y_hat = constant + coeff1 * total sq ft. of the house 
                   + coeff2 * number of bedrooms
                   + coeff2 * proximity to a highway
                   + ....

Test example:
(X, Y)

Inference

Autoregressive

The recent past may be a good indicator of the near future.

Stock price today >> stock price tomorrow

Time

Auto >> comparing with self
Regression >> predicting numeric/continuous values

time >> t

y(t+1) = constant + coff1 * y(t) + coff2 * y(t-1)

An autoregressive(AR) process model is a time series variable expressed as a linear combination of its own past values.


t = time period = monthly
s(t+1) = constant + coff1 * s(t) + coff2 * s(t-1)


s(t-1) >> s(t) >> s(t+1)

-----------------------------------------------------------------

AR (Auto Regressive)
MA (Moving Average)
ARMA (Auto Regressive Moving Average)


Stationarity
  > mean is constant
  > variance is constant
  > no seasonality

Check for stationarity:
 i) Visually inspect (plot)
 ii) Global vs. local tests
 iii) Statistical test (ADF - Augmented Dickey Fuller test)


How to make the time series stationary?

Perform differencing
z(t) = y(t) - y(t-1)


AR Model:
AR(3)

y(t) = beta_0 + beta_1 * y(t-1) + beta_2 * y(t-2) + beta_3 * y(t-3)



MA Model:

y(t) = mu + alpha_1 * error(t-1) + alpha_2 * error(t-2) + ....


ARMA(1, 1) 

y(t) = beta_0 + beta_1 * y(t-1) + alpha_1 * error(t-1) 



ACF : autocorrelation function >> MA
PACF: partial autocorrelation function >> AR


Seasonality
 > Repeating pattern over a period of an year 

ARIMA (Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average)
SARIMA (Seasonal Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average)

Autoregressive Process and Time Series

ACF: Auto-Correlation Function
PACF: Partial Auto-Correlation Function
Bars are alternating and dying down suggests that the time seriws is a moving average model.

Model selection for Time Series Analysis


ARIMA
------
ARIMA model is characterized by 3 terms: p, d, q

> Auto-Regressive (p) -> Number of autoregressive terms.
‘p’ is the order of the ‘Autoregressive’ (AR) term, it refers to the number of lags of y to be used as predictors

> Integrated (d) -> Number of nonseasonal differences needed for stationarity.
The value of d is the minimum number of differencing needed to make the series stationary if the time series is already stationary, then d = 0

> Moving Average (q) -> Number of lagged forecast errors in the prediction equation.
‘q’ is the order of the ‘Moving Average’ (MA) term, it refers to the number of lagged forecast errors that should go into the ARIMA Model.
