Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning

Supervised Learning: 
  X => data points with features (independent variable)
  y => target labels (dependent variable) (human annotated labels)

 > Regression Problem (Linear Regression) => y variable is numeric and continuous 

 > Classification Problem (Logistic Regression) => y variable is categorical
           IRIS flower classification => Setosa, Versicolor, Verginica
                                          0,        1,        2
  loss = y_pre - y_actual


General Purpose Artificial Intelligence >> achieving human-level intelligence
Special Purpose AI



Unsupervised Learning:
-----------------------
X => feature vectors in an n-dimensional space (only X is given)
(we don't have any y)

Unsupervised Learning
 > Clustering (grouping of data)
 > Association Rules (Apriori algorithms)
 > PCA
 > Autoencoders (Artificial Neural Networks)

Applications:
  > News Sections (topic modeling)
  > Computer Vision - object detection
  > Medical imaging 
  > Anomaly detection 
  > Customer personas
  > Recommendation Engines


Clustering
 > Partition-based Clustering - K-means algorithm
 > Coding example - step-by-step implementation
 > Using sklearn
 > Effect of different initializations
 > Goodness measure of a cluster - WCSS
 > Choosing the optimal number of clusters - k (Elbow plot)
 

30th April 2023
----------------
Unsupervised Learning
> Color image segmentation (color quantization)
> How good is the culstering: Silhouette score
> Coding examples - working with a real dataset

Exclusive and Overlapping Clustering
Exclusive clustering is a form of grouping that stipulates a data point can exist only in one cluster. 
This can also be referred to as “hard” clustering. The K-means clustering algorithm is an example of exclusive clustering.

Overlapping clusters differs from exclusive clustering in that it allows data points to belong to multiple clusters with separate degrees of membership. 
“Soft” or fuzzy k-means clustering is an example of overlapping clustering.

----------------------------------------
Other Clustering Methods:
> Hierarchical Clustering
  >> Agglomerative (bottoms-up approach)  
  >> Divisive (top-down approach)
> DBScan (density-based clustering)
> Probabilistic Clustering (GMM)
